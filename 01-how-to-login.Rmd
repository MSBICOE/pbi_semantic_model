You must install `Analyze in Excel Updates` from links provided in the Power BI service. Power BI detects the version of Excel you have on your computer, and automatically downloads the appropriate version (32-bit or 64-bit). The Power BI service runs in a browser. You can sign in to the Power BI using the following link:

Once you've signed in and the Power BI service is running in your browser, click the down arrow in the upper-right corner and then click Analyze in Excel updates as in the Figure \@ref(fig:pbi1).
